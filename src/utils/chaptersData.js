<b>Examples:</b> representing whole numbers:
in words (e.g., six hundred thirty-eight)
as numerals in standard notation (e.g., 638)
in expanded form (e.g., 600 + 30 + 8)
as a location on a number line:
A number line from 0 to 1000, labelled with increments of 1000. 638 is marked with a dot.
as the distance (magnitude) from zero on a number line:
A number line from 0 to 1000, labelled with increments of 1000. The magnitude of 638 is shown with an arrow which goes from 0 to 638.
using base ten materials:
327 can be represented using 3 flats (hundreds), 2 rods (tens), and 7 small cubes (ones or units)
327 represented with base ten materials. There are 3 flats, 2 rods, and 7 units.
composing whole numbers with relational rods:
using the fewest number of rods possible:
228 as 22 orange (10-unit) rods and 1 brown (8-unit) rod:
228 represented with relational rods. There are 22 ten rods and 1 eight rod.
as hops on an open number line:
638 on a number line. There is one hop of 600, one hop of 30, and one hop of 8 to reach 638.
decomposing whole numbers:
using place value:
600: 6 hundreds + 0 tens + 0 ones
by partitioning a line in half:
600:
There are two number lines. The one on top goes from 0 to 600. The one below is the same length and also goes from 0 to 600, but it is partitioned into two halves of 300 each.
<br/>
<b>Key Concepts:</b>
<br/>
Reading numbers involves interpreting them as a quantity when they are expressed in words, in standard notation, or represented using physical objects or diagrams.
The numerals 0 to 9 are used to form numbers. They are referred to as the digits in a number and each digit corresponds to a place value. For example, in the number 4107, the digit 4 represents 4 thousands, the digit 1 represents 1 hundred, the digit 0 represents 0 tens, and the digit 7 represents 7 ones.
There are patterns in the way numbers are formed. Each decade repeats the 0 to 9 counting sequence. Any quantity, no matter how great, can be described in terms of its place value.
A number can be represented in expanded form (e.g., 3187 = 3000 + 100 + 80 + 7 or 3 × 1000 + 1 × 100 + 8 × 10 + 7 × 1) to show place value relationships. 
Numbers can be composed and decomposed in various ways, including by place value.
Numbers are composed when two or more numbers are combined to create a larger number. For example, 300, 200, and 6 combine to make 506.
Numbers are decomposed when they are represented as a composition of two or more smaller numbers. For example, 512 can be represented as 250 and 250 and 10 and 2.
Tools may be used when representing numbers. For example, 362 may be represented as the sum of 36 ten-dollar bills and 1 toonie or 3 base ten flats, 6 base ten rods, and 2 base ten units. 
Numbers are used throughout the day, in various ways and contexts. Most often, numbers describe and compare quantities. They express magnitude and provide a way to answer questions such as “how much?” and “how much more?”.  
Note

Every strand in the mathematics curriculum relies on numbers.
Numbers may have cultural significance.
When a number is decomposed and then recomposed, the quantity is unchanged. This is the conservation principle.
There are non-standard but equivalent ways to decompose a number using place value, based on understanding the relationships between the place values. For example, 587 could be decomposed as 58 tens and 7 ones or decomposed as 50 tens and 87 ones, and so on.
Composing and decomposing numbers in a variety of ways can support students in becoming flexible with mental math strategies for addition and subtraction.
Closed, partial, and open number lines are important tools for representing numbers and showing the composition and decomposition of numbers. Numbers on a closed number line can be represented as a position on a number line or as a distance from zero. Partial number lines can be used to show the position of a number relative to other numbers. Open number lines can be used to show the composition of large numbers without drawing them to scale.
Breaking down numbers and quantities into smaller parts (decomposing) and reassembling them in new ways (composing) highlights relationships between numbers and builds strong number sense. Composing and decomposing numbers is also useful when doing a calculation or making a comparison.
As students build quantities to 1000 concretely, they should also use both written words and numerals to describe the quantity so that they can make connections among the representations.
Although students are formally required to represent numbers up to 1000 in Grade 3, representing other four-digit numbers will help them to better understand how place value including “one thousands” works (see B1.5).

export const B1_2_Whole_Numbers = `
<b>Examples:</b>comparing whole numbers:
using benchmark numbers like 500:
465 and 512:
512 is closer to 500 because it is only 12 away from 500, whereas 465 is 35 away from 500.
using digit values:
535 and 542:
535 = 500 + 30 + 5
542 = 500 + 40 + 2
The hundreds digits are the same, and the tens digits are different, so we compare the tens. The digit 3 is less than 4, so 535 is less than 542.
ordering whole numbers:
arranging numbers in ascending order from least to greatest:
65, 128, 456, 832
arranging numbers in descending order from greatest to least:
832, 456, 128, 65
<br/>
<b>Key concepts:</b>
<br/>Numbers are compared and ordered according to their “how muchness” or magnitude.
Numbers with the same units can be compared directly (e.g., 645 days compared to 625 days). Numbers that do not show a unit are assumed to have units of ones (e.g., 75 and 12 are considered as 75 ones and 12 ones).
Sometimes numbers without the same unit can be compared, such as 625 weeks and 75 days. Knowing that the unit "weeks" is greater than the unit "days", and knowing that 625 is greater than 75, one can infer that 625 weeks is a greater length of time than 75 days.
Benchmark numbers can be used to compare quantities. For example, 132 is less than 500 and 620 is greater than 500, so 132 is less than 620.
Numbers can be compared by their place value. For example, when comparing 825 and 845, the greatest place value in which the numbers differ is compared. For this example, 2 tens (from 825) and 4 tens (from 845) are compared. Since 4 tens is greater than 2 tens, 845 is greater than 825.
Numbers can be ordered in ascending order – from least to greatest – or can be ordered in descending order – from greatest to least.
Note

Understanding place value enables any number to be compared and ordered. There is a stable order to how numbers are sequenced, and patterns exist within this sequence that make it possible to predict the order of numbers and make comparisons.
Once millimetres have been introduced (see Spatial Sense, E2.2), the millimetre markings on a metre stick can serve as a physical number line that spans from 0 to 1000. Using the centimetre labels to determine the count of millimetres connects the Number strand to the Spatial Sense strand and strengthens the “times ten” mental math focus in B2.2.

<b>Examples:</b>

rounding in various contexts:
when adding and subtracting two-digit or three-digit numbers, to get a sense of what the exact answer will be
measuring using a smaller unit can help make a more accurate estimation for a larger unit. For example, if a pencil is 56 mm long, it is about 60 mm or 6 cm long
when using cash to pay for a purchase, for example, to determine how many dimes they would need to pay for an item that costs 67 cents
<br/>
<b>Key concepts:</b>
<br/>Rounding numbers is often done to estimate a quantity or measure, estimate the results of a computation, and make an estimated comparison.
How close a rounded number is to the original number depends on the unit or place value that it is being rounded to. A number rounded to the nearest ten is closer to the original number than a number being rounded to the nearest hundred. 
Whether a number is rounded “up” or “down” depends on the context. For example, when paying by cash in a store, the amount owing is rounded to the nearest five cents.
In the absence of a context, numbers are typically rounded based on the midpoint. This approach involves considering the amount that is halfway between two units and determining whether a number is closer to one unit than other:
Rounding 237 to the nearest 10 becomes 240, since 237 is closer to 240 than 230.
Rounding 237 to the nearest 100 becomes 200, since 237 is closer to 200 than 300.
If a number is exactly on the midpoint, the “half round up”, which is the common method for rounding would round up to the nearest 10. So, 235 rounded to the nearest 10 becomes 240.
Note

The degree to which a number is rounded is often determined by the precision that is required.

16 pieces of ribbon shared by 3 friends. Result is 5 and one third pieces each.
between 6 friends:
16 pieces of ribbon shared by 6 friends. Result is 2 and two thirds pieces each.
<br/>

<b>Key concepts:</b>

<br/>
Fair-sharing or equal-sharing means that quantities are shared equally. For a whole to be shared equally, it must be partitioned so that each sharer receives the same amount.
Sometimes the share is a whole number (e.g., if 4 pieces of ribbon are shared equally among 2 people, each person gets 2 pieces of ribbon).
Sometimes the share is a fractional amount (e.g., if 4 pieces of ribbon are shared equally among 8 people, each person gets one half of a ribbon).
Sometimes the share results in a whole plus a fractional amount (mixed number) (e.g., if 4 pieces of ribbon are shared equally among 3 people, each person gets 4 one thirds or 1 and one third pieces of the ribbon).
Comparing two different sharing situations involves reviewing the relationship (ratio) between the amount to be shared and the number of sharers.
If the amounts to be shared are the same, then the greater the number of sharers, the less each sharer gets.
If the number of sharers is the same, then the greater the amount to be shared, the greater each sharer gets.
If the amounts to be shared are the same as the number of sharers, then the amount each sharer gets is the same for each situation.
Note

Words can have multiple meanings. It is important to be aware that in many situations, fair does not mean equal, and equal is not equitable. Educators should clarify how they are using the term "fair share" and ensure that students understand that in the math context fair means equal and the intent behind such math problems is to find equal amounts.
Fair-share or equal-share problems provide a natural context for students to encounter fractions and division. Present these problems in the way that students will best connect to.
Fractional amounts can be expressed as a count of unit fractions (e.g., 2 one thirds), as words (e.g., two thirds), as a combination of numbers and words (e.g., 2 thirds), and symbolically (e.g.,
 ). As students come to understand fraction terms (halves, fourths, and so on) and use them independently, it is appropriate to introduce the corresponding symbolic fractional notation (see B2.9). Continuing to use all four ways of expressing fractions helps to reinforce the meaning behind the symbols.

equal-sharing context with fifths and tenths:
5 friends sharing 1 piece of flatbread:
One flatbread shared by five friends. The result is one fifth of the flatbread each.
Each friend splits their piece into 2 equal pieces, creating 10 equal pieces of flatbread. The one fifth that each friend has becomes two tenths (2 one tenths) that can be shared equally with another friend:
One flatbread shared by ten friends. The result is two tenths of the flatbread shared by each pair.

<b>Key concepts:</b>

<br/>
When something is shared fairly or equally as five pieces, each piece is 1 one fifth of the original amount. Five one fifths make up a whole.
When something is shared fairly or equally as ten pieces, each piece is 1 one tenth of the original amount. Ten one tenths make up a whole.
Fractions are equivalent when they represent the same value or quantity.
If the original amount is shared as five pieces or ten pieces, the fractions one fifth and 2 one tenths (two tenths) are equivalent. Similarly 2 one fifths (two fifths) and 4 one tenths (four tenths) are equivalent, 3 one fifths (three fifths) and 6 one tenths (six tenths) are equivalent, 4 one fifths (four fifths) and 8 one tenths (eight tenths) are equivalent, and 5 one tenths (five fifths), and 10 one tenths (ten tenths) are equivalent.
Different fractions can describe the same amount. Five tenths, four eighths, three sixths, and two fourths all represent the same amount as one half.
Note

Words can have multiple meanings. It is important to be aware that in many situations, fair does not mean equal, and equal is not equitable. Educators should clarify how they are using the term "fair share" and ensure that students understand that in the math context fair means equal and the intent behind such math problems is to find equal amounts.
Fair-share or equal-sharing scenarios provide a natural context for students to encounter and use equivalent fractions (see B1.6). Present these problems in the way that students will best connect to.
Patterns that exist between equivalent fractions can be used to generate other equivalent fractions.
When two fractions (or ratios) are equivalent, the relationships among the numerators and the denominators are constant. For example, in 
 and 
 , the denominator in both fractions is twice the numerator; and the numerator of one fraction is three times that of the other, just as the denominator of one is three times that of the other.

export const C1_1_Patterns = `
<b>Key Concepts</b>
Patterns may involve a repeating element and a repeating operation (e.g., in a design, different sizes of squares may be repeated).
The shortest string of elements that repeat in a pattern is referred to as the “pattern core”.
The quantifying measure or numerical value in a pattern may involve a repeat of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Note

Students can engage in mathematics and patterns through the contexts, cultural histories, and stories of various cultures. 
Have students focus on how attributes are staying the same and how they are changing.
A repeat operation involving addition and subtraction of zero will result in a pattern whose elements are not altered.
A repeat operation involving multiplication and division by one will result in a pattern whose elements are not altered.

`;

export const C1_2_Patterns = `
<b>Key Concepts</b>
The same pattern structure can be represented in various ways.
Patterns with a repeating element can be based on attributes (e.g., colour, size, orientation).
Patterns with a repeating operation can be based on repeating operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division.
Pattern structures can be generalized.
When translating a pattern from a concrete representation to a table of values, each iteration of the pattern can be referred to as the term number, and the number of elements in each iteration can be referred to as the term value. In a table of values, the term number is shown in the left-hand column and the term value is shown in the right-hand column.
Note

Comparing translated patterns highlights the equivalence of their underlying mathematical structure, even though the representation differs.
`;

export const C1_3_Patterns = `
<b>Key Concepts</b>
Patterns can be extended because they are repetitive by nature.
Pattern rules are generalizations about a pattern, and they can be described in words.
Patterns can be extended in multiple directions – up, down, right, left, diagonally.
To make a near prediction about a pattern is to state or show what a pattern will look like just beyond the given representation of that pattern. The prediction can be verified by extending the pattern.
To make a far prediction about a pattern is to state or show what a pattern will look like well beyond the given representation of that pattern. Often calculations are needed to make an informed prediction or to verify a prediction.
To identify missing elements of patterns is to complete a representation for a given pattern by filling in the missing parts.
Note

In order to extend, predict, or determine missing elements, students need to generalize patterns, using pattern rules.
Rules should be used to verify predictions and to critically analyse extensions and solutions for missing elements.

export const C2_1_Equalities = `
<b>Key concepts</b>
Variables are used in formulas (e.g., the perimeter of a square can be determined by four times its side length (s), which can be expressed as 4s).
Variables are used in coding so that the code can be run more than once with different numbers.
Variables are defined when doing a mathematical modelling task.
Note

Identifying quantities in real life that stay the same and those that can change will help students understand the concept of variability.
Identifying what is constant and what changes is one aspect of mathematical modelling.
When students find different addends for a sum no more than 200, they are implicitly working with variables. These numbers are like variables that can change (e.g., in coding, a student’s code could be TotalSteps = FirstSteps + SecondSteps).
In mathematics notation, variables are only expressed as letters or symbols. When coding, variables may be represented as words, abbreviated words, symbols, or letters.
Students are also implicitly working with variables as they are working with attributes (e.g., length, mass, colour, number of buttons), as the value of those attributes can vary.
`;

export const C2_2_Equalities = `
<b>Key concepts</b>
Numerical expressions are equivalent when they produce the same result, and an equal sign is the symbol denoting two equivalent expressions.
Numerical expressions are not equivalent when they do not produce the same result, and an equal sign with a slash through it (
 ), is a symbol denoting that the two expressions are not equivalent.
Various strategies can be used to determine whether expressions are equivalent. Visual representations of the expressions can be manipulated until they look the same or close to the same.
Note

The equal sign should not be interpreted as the "answer", but rather, that both parts on either side of the equal sign are equal, therefore creating balance.
